This is a BDD Framework using Java, Selenium, Cucumber, Maven, and JUnit.
It also uses WebDriverManager dependency to set up driver for UI automation.
The execution point is Notarize/src/test/java/runner/TestRunner class
When you trigger the execution in the TestRunner class,
it reads the scenario steps from Notarize/src/test/resources/feature/Login.feature file
and it finds the actual code implementation in the Notarize/src/test/java/steps/LoginSteps class.
It also finds the tag defined in the runner class in the feature file.
After executing all the scenarios, it creates a HTML report under Notarize/target/cucumber-reports/index.html file.
To be able to see the reports after execution, right click on the index.html file, Open In > Browser > Chrome.
This will show you the reports for the execution.

NOTE: Everything is defined in the runner class with CucumberOptions tag, in that we have
features which states where the feature files are,
tag which states which scenarios to be executed,
glue which states where the step implementations are,
plugin to define what kind of reports will be executed after execution.
